# Comp-3000-Final-project
The github respository for dominic cole for his comp 3000 final project
Inspirations for the project:
The project too major inspirations from other 2d roguelike dungeon crawlers within the gaming industry these would be games such as binding of isaac, enter the gungeon and risk of rain, these all come from different developers but all show a love and care for the genre to innovate and refind what it previously was and this inspired me to want to be able to produce a product within this genre as a someone who was heavily inspired by them to become a game developer.
Another major part of the inspiration for the project was to make tools for my future projects that can be reused within unity 2D game engine, the major tool will be random generation for levels and how they work within the game.
What is in this project:
This project contains scripts used for dungeon generation, player movement, player attacks both melee and ranged, UI usage for health bars and Money script. enemy following script that chases the player, enemy attacks, enemy health bar UI part that appears when damaged, Gem that be able to pick up and interact with and health pot that are able to heal the player.
